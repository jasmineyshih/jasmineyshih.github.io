---

In Spring 2019, I worked with professors [Eric Shaffer](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/shaffer1) and [Ranjitha Kumar](http://ranjithakumar.net/) to develop visual anaylytics tools to visualize and study patterns in over 5000 entries of emoji expressions (strings of up to five emoji) posted by users of Opico, an emoji-first and location-centric social mobile platform. The Opico app is no longer being maintained or developed, but you can still access the interactive web visualizations at [https://jasmineyshih.github.io/opicoVis/](https://jasmineyshih.github.io/opicoVis/).
